 * This file contains the data required for the interface between the 
 * base DMA driver (xdma) and the application-specific drivers, for example,

 * TRD with other application-specific drivers, without re-writing the
 * common DMA-handling functionality.
 *
 * Some xdma functions are called directly by the application-specific driver
 * and some are callbacks registered by the application-specific driver, 
 * and are called by xdma.

 * </pre>
 * <b> Driver Registration/De-registration </b>
 *
 * The application-specific drivers are dependent on the DMA driver and 
 * can be inserted as Linux kernel modules only after xdma has been loaded.
 *
 * To register itself with xdma, the application-specific driver does the
 * following, while specifying the engine number and BAR number it requires,
 * a set of function callback pointers, and the minimum packet size it
 * normally uses -
 * <pre> Handle = DmaRegister(int Engine, int Bar, UserPtrs * uptr, int PktSize); </pre>
 * The application-specific driver requires to know the kernel logical
 * address of the desired BAR in order to do any device-specific 
 * initializations that may be required. For example, the xgbeth driver
 * requires to program the TEMAC and PHY registers, while the xaui driver
 * requires to control the test configuration.
 *
 * Before returning to the caller, DmaRegister() will invoke the function 
 * callback registered to complete the initialization process, while 
 * specifying the BAR's logical address, and a private data pointer that 
 * was passed to it during registration. privData can be used by the user
 * driver to differentiate between multiple DmaRegister() invocations -
 * <pre> (uptr->UserInit)(BARbase, privData); </pre>
 * <b><i> Note: The application-specific driver's UserInit() function call must
 * be written in such a way that it works fine even when the DmaRegister()
 * call is not yet complete. </i></b>
 *
 * If the registration process is successful, a handle is returned which
 * should be used in all other function calls to xdma.
 *
 * To unregister itself from xdma, the application-specific driver does the
 * following, while passing the handle it received after registration -
 * <pre> DmaUnregister(Handle); </pre>
* Before returning to the caller, DmaUnregister() will invoke the function
* callback registered to enable any device-specific programming to be done
* as part of the de-registration process.
* <pre> (uptr->UserRemove)(Handle, privData); </pre>
* Before returning to the caller, DmaUnregister() also returns all the
* packet buffers that had been passed to it for transmission or reception.
* Incase these buffers are still unused, they are flagged as PKT_UNUSED.
* <pre> (uptr->UserPutPkt)(Handle, PktBuf * pkts, int NumPkts, privData); </pre>
* <b><i> Note: UserRemove() is not being invoked in xdma v1.00, and will be
* added in the future. </i></b>
*
* <b> Buffer Handling </b>
*
* For better performance, the DMA driver always sets up large buffer
* descriptor (BD) rings, one for transmission and one for reception. The
* TX BD ring will be consumed only when there is data for transmission.
* The RX BD ring, on the other hand, will be entirely submitted for DMA
* in order to maximize performance. 
* 
* <b> Data Transmission </b>
*
* When the application-specific driver wants to transmit a data block or
* packet, it invokes the following, while passing an array of one or more
* packets to be transmitted -
* <pre> DmaSendPkt(Handle, PktBuf * pkts, int NumPkts); </pre>
* When data transmission is completed, the packet buffers will be returned
* to the application-specific driver by invoking the following -
* <pre> (uptr->UserPutPkt)(Handle, PktBuf * pkts, int NumPkts, privData); </pre>
* It is important to return these buffers to the application-specific
* driver even though they are TX packets, since they would need to be
* freed or re-used as the case may be.
*
* <b> Data Reception </b>
*
* The DMA driver needs to set up the complete BD ring with buffers ready
* for reception. Hence, it invokes the following, while specifying the number
* of packet buffers it wants, and their size -
* <pre> (uptr->UserGetPkt)(Handle, PktBuf * pkts, uint Size, int NumPkts, privData); </pre>
* As data reception happens and buffers get used, they are returned to the
* application-specific driver, by invoking the following -
* <pre> (uptr->UserPutPkt)(Handle, PktBuf * pkts, int NumPkts, privData); </pre>
* The DMA driver will again invoke UserGetPkt() in order to replenish the
* used BDs in its BD ring.
*
* <b> Interrupts </b>
*
* The DMA driver can operate in either a polled mode or interrupt-driven
* mode, by modifying a compile-time flag. The application-specific driver
* can optionally enable application-specific interrupts. When an interrupt
* occurs, the DMA driver will invoke the following, to enable handling of
* these interrupt events -
* <pre> (uptr->UserIntr)(Handle, privData); </pre>
* <b><i> Note: This callback is not being invoked by xdma v1.00, and will be
* added in the future. </i></b>
* 
* <b> Configuration, Status and Statistics </b>
*
* The Xilinx Performance Monitor GUI (xpmon) can be used to initiate a
* data transfer test and measure DMA payload and PCIe link performance. 
* xdma invokes the following, while specifying whether loopback is enabled
* or not, and the minimum/maximum bounds of packet sizes -
* <pre> (uptr->UserSetState)(Handle, UserState * ustate, privData); </pre>
* The same callback is used to start a test, and to stop a test. 
* 
* xdma invokes the following, in order to get current state of the 
* application-specific driver -
* <pre> (uptr->UserGetState)(Handle, UserState * ustate, privData); </pre>
* Information regarding current test state, link state, total number of
* buffers is returned and can be displayed in the xpmon GUI.

	/** Packet information passed between DMA and application-specific 
	 *  drivers while transmitting and receiving data.
	 *  A PktBuf array can be used to pass multiple packets between user
	 *  and DMA drivers. It includes the following information -
	 *  - pktBuf is the virtual address of a packet buffer
	 *  - bufInfo is the per-packet identifier that the user driver may need to
	 *  associate with the packet. When the packet is returned from the
	 *  DMA driver to the user driver, this association remains intact and can
	 *  be retrieved by the user driver.
	 *  - The size of the packet buffer.
	 *  - When the user submits a packet for DMA, the flags can be a combination
	 *    of PKT_SOP, PKT_EOP and PKT_ALL. PKT_ALL indicates to the DMA driver
	 *    that all of the packets in the submitted array must be queued for DMA.
	 *    This will usually be done when the queued packets are fragments of a 
	 *    larger user packet.
	 *  - When the DMA driver returns a packet to the user driver, the flags can
	 *    be a combination of PKT_SOP, PKT_EOP, PKT_ERROR and PKT_UNUSED. 
	 *    PKT_UNUSED indicates that the packet buffer is being returned unused
	 *    and does not contain valid data. This is usually done when the drivers
	 *    are being unloaded and unregistered, and therefore, packets have been
	 *    retrieved without completing DMA.
